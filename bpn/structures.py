        The underlying idea stems from the following. Say we have this
        original formation of edges in the original graph:

            head1   head2
              |       |

        Then we wish to swap the edges between these four nodes as one
        of the two following possibilities:

            head1   head2       head1---head2
                 \ /
                  X
                 / \
            tail1   tail2       tail1---tail2

        We approach both by following through the first of the two
        possibilities, but before committing to the edge creation, give
        a chance that we flip the nodes `head1` and `tail1`.
